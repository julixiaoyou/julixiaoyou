# ðŸ‘‹ Hey â€” I'm **Juli**
A student developer from Germany. I love programming, math and philosophy. Right now: Creating stuff with OpenGL.

**Math Â· Graphical API's Â· C++**

---

## ðŸ”­ What I care about
- Learning how low-level stuff works (registers, pointers, memory)  
- Learning about hardware components and how theyre built  

---

## ðŸ§  What I'm learning (live)
```bash
juli@learning ~ $ cat current_projects.txt
> Solving math problems & undrstanding physics
> Learn as much C++ as possible

```


## ðŸ“š My journey so far
I started programming in Java, but quickly fell in love with understanding how things work on a deeper level. Since I like to work with hardware alot I pivoted towards C and C++, and also know how to code in Assembly. I also really like to use OpenGL/Vulkan to test out how the GPU works on a more detailed level.
